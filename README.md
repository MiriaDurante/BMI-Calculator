# BMI Calculator
This is a simple *Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator*, developed as a *native Android application using Kotlin*. The main goal is to calculate BMI based on user input and display the result on a new screen.

## :camera_flash: Screenshots
This project was developed for Portuguese-speaking users. The BMI calculation includes five possible categories, which are displayed alongside the result. Below are two examples: one showing a Normal BMI result and the other showing an Obesity BMI result.
